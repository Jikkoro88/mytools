To use this:
1) copy the sysbench 0.5 binary into this directoy
2) copy the tests directory from sysbench into this directory so that tests/db/oltp.lua exists
3) run.sh assume that root/pw is a valid login and the database is at 127.0.0.1:3306

Use all.sh to run all tests. A command line is: bash all.sh 8 1000000 180 300 rocksdb 1 0
